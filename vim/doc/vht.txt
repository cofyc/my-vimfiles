*vht*

VHT is Vim implementation of Macromedia Dreamweaver(tm) templates and
libraries. Templates make possible to share the same document template across
whole project, libraries allow for sharing the same snippet of code in many
documents. This plugin makes possible to commit and update code from
repositories and take care about file paths in links and image tags, always
changing them to be relative to currently edited file.

VHT doesn't provide immediate way to propagate changes across whole site.
There is too many ways to maintain project in Vim. From session files, through
project plugins from vim-online to simple file with list of files and opening
it with "vim `cat fileslist`".

All commands work nice with :argdo, :windo, :bufdo set of commands.
But you have to run ":argdo VHTupdate" twice. First time will be for setting
template source.

==============================================================================
1. Templates                             *vht-templates*

1.1. Creating template                   *vht-create-template*

At the beginning you have to prepare project by creating file index.htmlmain
at the root level of your site project and directory "Templates" (Note big
T at the beginning).

The easiest way to create template is to write a html document. After finishing
example choose regions which should be different on various pages of your
site. This regions enclose in tags: >
	<!-- #BeginEditable "regionname" -->

	<!-- #EndEditable -->

Note: regionname MUST be unique in your document, when there will be more than
one region of the same name only contents of the first will be saved.

Note: Region name MUST follow Vim variable name specification: variable name
can be made up of letters, digits and '_'.  But it cannot start with a digit.

                                         *vht-regionname-format*
Opening tag of editable region MUST follow specification: >
	^\s*<!-- #BeginEditable "[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*" -->\s*$'

All tags have to be in separate lines.

                                          *:VHTinsert* *vht-insert-template*
:VHTinsert [{regionname}]
Easy way to insert region template is to use |:VHTinsert| command. Example: >
	:VHTinsert regionname

It will check if region name is properly declared and put below cursor
position:
	<!-- #BeginEditable "regionname" --> ~
	<!-- #EndEditable --> ~
With cursor on first line. If you don't declare name only "" will be printed.

Paths to files in <img> and <a> tags should be relative to current file.

After finishing it issue a command: >
	:VHTcommit template1
File, without regions marked as editable will be written to file
"Templates/template1.vht" (counting from level of index.htmlmain file). 
Great! You created your first Vim HTML template.

Note: In Dreamweaver template files have extension .dwt . Because VHT isn't
100% compatible (especially region names limitations) there is no direct
support for .dwt files.

All template operations have built-in security checks for region name
specification. You can check it separately with |:VHTcheck| command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2. Creating document from template     *vht-create-document*

:VHTcheckout [{tmplname}]                *:VHTcheckout*
	Now, when you have template you probably want to create new files
	which base on it. Create new html file, and enter: >
	    :VHTcheckout template1
<       Done. VHT will load template and adjust file paths.

	You can also give only ":VHTcheckout", VHT will show list of templates
	from Templates dir: >
	    You didn't specify Template name.
	    Enter name of template -
	    template1
	    (<Enter> to abandon action): 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3. Commiting template                  *vht-commit-template*

:VHTcommit [{tmplname}]                  *:VHTcommit*
	Sometimes you want to change template and make this changes available
	in other file (or create new one). Do this with known command: >
	    :VHTcommit
<       Now, here is little trick. Plugin not always know with which template
	file is associated. If you didn't perform any template action
	previously you will be asked for name of template: >
	    You didn't specify Template name.
	    Enter name of existing template -
	    template1
	    Or a new one (<Enter> to abandon action): 
<
	Name of template is stored in b:vhtemplate variable (local to current
	buffer - |b:var|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4. Updating file                       *vht-update-template*

:VHTupdate [{tmplname}]                  *:VHTupdate*
	After making change in template it is good to update other files dependant on
	this template. Example: >
	    :VHTupdate template1
<
	When you call command without argument, two things can happen depending on
	existence of b:vhtemplate variable. If it exists, VHT will update file
	automatically from this template. If not, you will see know prompt: >
	    You didn't specify Template name.
	    Enter name of template -
	    template1
	    (<Enter> to abandon action): 

What will happen when update will be done from template not on which file was
based? New template will be load and old regions will be stored in variables
like b:vht_regionname. You can put them in desired locations. Note: if in new
template are the same region names like in the old one regions will be
automatically pasted there. This is a good idea to keep region names the same
for most important things like - doctitle, content, footer, etc. In this way
even changing to completely different template, content will be placed in
proper place.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5. Strip template tags                 *vht-strip-template*

:VHTstrip {all}                          *:VHTstrip*
	This command will remove editable region tags from document. Used
	without argument will remove tags of current or last editable region.
	With {all} argument will remove all tags from current document. This
	command removes only tags, not lines to preserve line positions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6. Checking regions names              *vht-check-regions*

:VHTcheck                                *:VHTcheck*
        With this command you check if you declared region names properly: >
	    :VHTcheck
<       If there are any wrong region names like
	    <!-- #BeginEditable "This is header" --> ~
	(spaces are not allowed in region names)
	You will get message:
	    Not all editable regions were safely declared. List of them: ~
	     54:    <!-- #BeginEditable "This is header" --> ~
	    End of operation. ~

==============================================================================
2. Libraries                             *vht-libraries*

2.1. Creating library                    *vht-create-library*

When you want to share some piece of HTML between many files, you want
Library. This is a piece of code placed between tags: >
	<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "libitem.vhl" -->

	<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->

"libitem.vhl" is a path to library item relative to index.htmlmain file It can be: >
	<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "libitem.vhl" -->
	<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "Library/libitem.vhl" -->
	<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/libitem.vhl" -->

"Library" is a default path to look for files with extensions .vhl and .lbi
(Dreamweaver) and good idea to store many pieces of code and not clutter main
directory. VHT also accepts things like: >
	<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "~/Library/libitem.vhl" -->

For global library from home directory (may work only under *nix). 

After closing region in mentioned tags place cursor somewhere between them
and type command: >
	:VHLcommit
It will write library item to its destination declared in opening tag.

                                          *:VHLinsert* *vht-insert-library*
:VHLinsert [{libname}]
Easy way to insert library template is to use |:VHLinsert| command. Example: >
	:VHLinsert libname

It will check if region name is properly declared and put below cursor
position:
	<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "libname" --> ~
	<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> ~
With cursor on first line. If you don't declare name only "" will be printed.

Command will check if libname has '.vhl' extension and add it automatically if
not.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Checkouting library                 *vht-checkout-library*

:VHLcheckout [{libpath}]                 *:VHLcheckout*
	To insert library item at cursor position you need: >
	    :VHLcheckout
<       You will get list of existing library items (files with extensions .vhl and
	.lbi) in directories of index.htmlmain and Library at level of
	.htmlmain file.  Insert _full_ shown path with extension: >
	    You didn't specify Library path.
	    Enter path to existing library -
	    test.vhl
	    Library/libitem.vhl
	    (<Enter> to abandon action): 
<
	In this case you should enter "test.vhl" or "Library/libitem.vhl"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3. Commiting library                   *vht-commit-library*

:VHLcommit [ all ]                       *:VHLcommit*
	When you made changes to library item and want to make those changes
	available to other files type: >
	    :VHLcommit
<       This will find current or last library item and commit changes to
        "repository".

	If you want to commit all library items in current document type: >
	    :VHLcommit all

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4. Updating library                    *vht-update-library*

:VHLupdate [ all ]                       *:VHLupdate*
        When you want to update library item type: >
	    :VHLupdate
<       This will find current or last library item and make changes to
	"repository".
	If you want update all library items in current document enter: >
	    :VHLupdate all
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5. Strip library  tags                 *vht-strip-library*

:VHLstrip {all}                          *:VHLstrip*
	This command will remove tags of libraries from document. Used
	without argument will remove tags of current or last library.
	With {all} argument will remove all tags from current document. This
	command removes only tags, not lines to preserve line positions.

==============================================================================
3. Various

3.1 Show resources                       *vht-show*

Before using templates its good to see what you can use.

:VHTshow                                 *:VHTshow*
	This command will show template which is currently assigned to your
	document (NONE if there is no assigned template yet).
                                        
:VHLshow                                 *:VHLshow*
	This command will show libraries available in project.  Libraries are
	files with extensions .vhl and .lbi in .htmlmain directory or Library
	directory located there.
